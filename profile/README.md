## Pixel Services üöÄ

### üë®‚Äçüíª Who are we?
Hello there, we are [**Pixel Services**](https://pixel-services.com/). We offer [**Professional Minecraft & Discord Development**](https://discord.gg/KTF3Wsk85G), [**Cheap Hosting**](https://hosting.pixel-services.com/), and many [**other Services**](https://discord.gg/KTF3Wsk85G).  

### üõ†Ô∏è Open Source
Apart from our paid services, we are strong supporters of the **open-source movement**. In this GitHub organization, we focus on creating and maintaining **open-source projects** that are unrelated to our paid services. We welcome contributions from the community to help improve these projects.

If you make **significant contributions** to our open-source projects, you could earn the opportunity to join Pixel Services' **Open Source Division** as an official Member. This role comes with the exciting privilege of **managing** and **maintaining** repositories owned by Pixel Services, as well as the chance to **pitch new ideas and initiatives** directly to our team.

But that‚Äôs not all‚Äîif you excel in the Open Source Division, there‚Äôs potential for even more! You could become an official member of the Pixel Services team, taking on paid commissions and collaborating with us under our brand, further expanding your impact and professional growth.
